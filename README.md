- Details about light settings
	- Compressed lightmaps [Unchecked]
		- In my case I unchecked this option. If you chosee this option in Android you will gain less size in the lightmaps file but you don't have a "real" ilumination. I understand that the file size too small generated "yellows" and "greys" like a fake shadows and raw. That appearance is similar to old videogames of 90's but not enough good for a project more realistics.
		- The reason of this appears in the [Global Illumination from Unity 3D docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GlobalIllumination.html), they say the compression process can introduce unwanted visual effects into the texture.
